# Agents

## Overview

Agents in AnswerAI are advanced AI systems that go beyond simple text generation. They use Language Models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to determine and execute actions, making them powerful tools for complex tasks and decision-making processes.

## Key Benefits

- Enhanced Problem-Solving: Agents can tackle multi-step problems by breaking them down and using appropriate tools.
- Adaptability: They can interact with various APIs and custom scripts, expanding their capabilities.
- Autonomous Decision-Making: Agents can determine when to take actions and when a task is complete.

## How to Use

1. Select an Agent node in the AnswerAI Studio canvas.
2. Configure the agent with the necessary tools and APIs.
3. Set up the input prompts and parameters.
4. Connect the agent to other nodes in your workflow.
5. Run the workflow to see the agent in action.

## Types of Agent Nodes

### Agent Nodes

- [OpenAI Assistant](openai-assistant/)
- [Tool Agent](tool-agent.md)

## Agents vs. Other Chains

Unlike traditional chains that primarily process and generate text, Agents in AnswerAI have unique capabilities:

1. Tool Utilization: Agents can use a variety of tools to interact with external systems and data sources.
   - API Interactions: Agents can make API calls to retrieve or send data.
   - Custom JavaScript Execution: They can run custom JavaScript code for specialized tasks.
   - Database Queries: Agents can interact with databases to fetch or update information.

2. Decision-Making: Agents use their LLM core to decide which actions to take based on the current context and available tools.

3. Iterative Processing: They can perform multiple steps, evaluating the results of each action to determine the next steps.

4. Dynamic Workflow: Agents can adapt their behavior based on intermediate results, creating more flexible and responsive workflows.

5. Self-Monitoring: They can assess whether a task is complete or if additional actions are needed.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. Clearly define the agent's objective and available tools.
2. Start with simpler tasks and gradually increase complexity.
3. Regularly review and refine the agent's performance.
4. Combine agents with other nodes for more sophisticated workflows.

## Troubleshooting

- If an agent is not performing as expected, check the tool configurations and input prompts.
- Ensure that all necessary API keys and permissions are correctly set up.
- Review the agent's thought process in the execution logs to identify any logical errors.
